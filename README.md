# Reddit Stable Diffusion-izer

## What is this?

This Python script grabs top posts from Reddit, saves the titles, and downloads the images. It then sends the images 
through a WebUI running Stable Diffusion (or any other model) with the title as the prompt. The results are then
concatenated together and a caption slapped on top.
